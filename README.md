🦅🌟 Hoo Bank Website🌟🦅


I'm thrilled to launch Hoo Bank—a web app where I turn ideas into digital reality using:
HTML5, CSS3,Tailwind, JS (ES5, ES6), ReactJS with Hooks.

I want to mention that this project holds special significance as it's my first experience with Tailwind CSS, a modern framework that offers several advantages over traditional CSS.


I'm truly excited to explore the capabilities of Tailwind CSS and bring elegant and modern designs to life. This project serves as a stepping stone before I embark on my journey into backend development.
